# Example 1: Values

Go has various value types including strings, integers, floats, booleans, etc. Here are a few basic examples. 

Strings, which can be added together with +. Integers and floats. Booleans, with boolean operators as youâ€™d expect.

Source code is shown in [`values.go`](https://github.com/luangtatipsy/go-by-example/blob/main/01-values/values.go).

After execute `go run 02-values/values.go` from the root resository directory. The outputs are shown below
```
golang
1+1 = 2
7.0/3.0 = 2.3333333333333335
false
